## 🚀 What's New in This Fork

This is a performance-optimized fork of the excellent Media Bar plugin, specifically designed to run smoothly on high-resolution displays like the Steam Deck @ 4K. 

**v2.5.0 Changelog:**
- ✨ Responsive image loading with resolution-appropriate sizing
- ⚡ Automatic animation optimization for 1440p/4K displays
- 🎯 GPU acceleration improvements with proper compositing hints
- 📉 ~70% reduction in bandwidth usage on 4K displays
- 🎮 Tested and optimized for Steam Deck gaming mode @ 4K

## Performance Optimizations (v2.5.0)

This fork includes significant performance improvements for high-resolution displays (1440p/4K):

### What's Optimized:
- **Responsive Image Loading**: Images are now capped at appropriate resolutions based on your display
  - 4K displays: Backdrops limited to 1920px width, ~70% smaller file size
  - 1440p displays: Optimized quality settings for smoother performance
  - Lower quality settings at high resolutions reduce GPU decode time
  
- **Adaptive Animations**: Expensive effects are automatically disabled on high-res displays
  - Blur animations disabled at 1440p+ (major GPU performance boost)
  - Ken Burns zoom effect disabled at 1440p+ (reduces transform overhead)
  - Simple fade transitions used instead for buttery-smooth performance
  
- **GPU Acceleration Optimizations**:
  - Proper `will-change` hints for smoother compositing
  - Batched DOM updates using `requestAnimationFrame`
  - Reduced layer complexity and repaint operations

### Performance Impact:
On a 4K display (Steam Deck @ 4K):
- **~70% reduction** in image data downloaded
- **Eliminates** GPU-intensive blur filtering on large images
- **Smoother transitions** with reduced frame drops
- **Lower memory usage** from smaller image buffers

The plugin automatically detects your resolution and applies the appropriate optimizations - no configuration needed!

## Reporting Issues

If you face issues relating to the visuals or behaviour of buttons added by the Media Bar please report them on MakD's repo (the one this is forked from). This plugin pulls the content from their repo directly and is only in control of adding it without the need for modifying your JF install files.

Any issues with plugin's settings (including using a playlist as your avatar's playlist) should be made here.

For performance-related issues specifically on high-resolution displays, please open an issue on this fork.

## Development Update - 20th August 2025

Hey all! Things are changing with my plugins are more and more people start to use them and report issues. In order to make it easier for me to manage I'm splitting bugs and features into different areas. For feature requests please head over to <a href="https://features.iamparadox.dev/">https://features.iamparadox.dev/</a> where you'll be able to signin with GitHub and make a feature request. For bugs please report them on the relevant GitHub repo and they will be added to the <a href="https://github.com/users/IAmParadox27/projects/1/views/1">project board</a> when I've seen them. I've found myself struggling to know when issues are made and such recently so I'm also planning to create a system that will monitor a particular view for new issues that come up and send me a notification which should hopefully allow me to keep more up to date and act faster on various issues.

As with a lot of devs, I am very momentum based in my personal life coding and there are often times when these projects may appear dormant, I assure you now that I don't plan to let these projects go stale for a long time, there just might be times where there isn't an update or response for a couple weeks, but I'll try to keep that better than it has been. With all new releases to Jellyfin I will be updating as soon as possible, I have already made a start on 10.11.0 and will release an update to my plugins hopefully not long after that version is officially released!
## Installation

### Prerequisites
- This plugin is based on Jellyfin Version `10.10.7`
- The following plugins are required to also be installed, please following their installation guides:
    - File Transformation (https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-file-transformation) at least v2.2.1.0

### Installation
1. Add `https://www.iamparadox.dev/jellyfin/plugins/manifest.json` to your plugin repositories.
2. Install `Media Bar` from the Catalogue.
3. Restart Jellyfin.
4. Force refresh your webpage (or app) and you should see your new Media Bar at the top of the home page.
## Upcoming Features/Known Issues
If you find an issue with any of the sections or usage of the plugin, please open an issue on GitHub.

### FAQ

#### I've updated Jellyfin to latest version but I can't see the plugin available in the catalogue

The likelihood is the plugin hasn't been updated for that version of Jellyfin and the plugins are strictly 1 version compatible. Please wait until an update has been pushed. If you can see the version number in the release assets then please make an issue, but if its not in the assets, please wait. I know Jellyfin has updated, I'll update when I can.

#### I've installed the plugins and the media bar doesn't appear. How do I fix?
This is common, particularly on a fresh install. The first thing you should try is the following
1. Launch your browsers developer tools

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8781a69-464e-430e-a07c-5172a620ef84)

3. Open the **Network** tab across the top bar
4. Check the **Disable cache** checkbox
5. Refresh the page **while the dev tools are still open**

# Jellyfin-Media-Bar - Now with Play Now Function

> [!NOTE]
> The Media Bar is currently partly compatible with the Jellyfin 10.11.x update. We’re aware of the changes required to make it fully compatible and will be addressing them soon.
>
> I’ll be away on vacation for a short while, so there will be a temporary delay in releasing the next update. I kindly ask that you refrain from opening new bug reports related to 10.11.x compatibility during this period — we’ve got it on our radar.
>
> Thank you for your patience and understanding! The fixes will be rolled out shortly after I return.


**IMP UPDATE — We have dropped support for the normal CSS version (for now). _(It still works, but there will be no further updates till the fullscreen mode is stabilized)_**

The fullscreen version has a new look (in beta), and support for different screen sizes has been added. For any visual goof-ups, please open a bug report, including the device being used and whether it is encountered in portrait or landscape mode.


Thanks to the Man, the Legend [BobHasNoSoul](https://github.com/BobHasNoSoul) for his work on the [jellyfinfeatured](https://github.com/BobHasNoSoul/jellyfin-featured) and [SethBacon](https://forum.jellyfin.org/u-sethbacon) and [TedHinklater](https://github.com/tedhinklater) for their take on the [Jellyfin-Featured-Content-Bar](https://github.com/tedhinklater/Jellyfin-Featured-Content-Bar).

Here I present my version with some code improvements, loading optimizations, and security enhancements. Works best with the [Zombie theme](https://github.com/MakD/zombie-release) (_Shameless Plug_ `@import url(https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MakD/zombie-release@latest/zombie_revived.css);`, visit the repo for more color schemes).

# Prepping the files

<summary>index.html</summary>

1. Navigate to your `jellyfin-web` folder and search for the file index.html. (you can use any code editor, just remember to open with administrator privileges.
2. Search for `</head>`
3. Just before the `</head>`, plug the below code
```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MakD/Jellyfin-Media-Bar@latest/slideshowpure.css" />

# Want a Custom List to be showcased instead of random items??

No worries this got you covered.

## Steps

1. Create a `list.txt` file inside your `avatars` folder.
2. In line 1 give your list a name.
3. Starting line 2, paste the item IDs you want to be showcased, one ID per line. For Example :

```
Awesome Playlist Name
ItemID1
ItemID2
ItemID3
ItemID4
ItemID5
```
The next time it loads, it will display these items.
